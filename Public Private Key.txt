In the context of server-side communication and security, a public key and a certificate play important roles:

Public key: A public key is a cryptographic key that is made available to others for encryption or verification purposes. In the server-side context, the server generates a public-private key pair. The public key is shared with clients, allowing them to encrypt data or verify digital signatures generated by the server.

Encryption: Clients can use the server's public key to encrypt sensitive information before sending it to the server. Only the server possessing the corresponding private key can decrypt the encrypted data.
Digital signatures: The server can use its private key to generate digital signatures for data it sends to clients. Clients can then verify the authenticity and integrity of the data using the server's public key.
Certificate: A certificate is a digitally signed document that binds a public key to the identity of an entity (in this case, the server). It serves as a means to verify the authenticity and integrity of the server's public key. The certificate is issued by a trusted certificate authority (CA) and includes the following information:

Subject: The identity information of the server, such as its domain name.
Public key: The server's public key.
Digital signature: A cryptographic signature generated by the CA using its private key, ensuring the certificate's authenticity and integrity.
When a client connects to a server, it receives the server's certificate, verifies the digital signature using the CA's public key, and confirms that the certificate is issued by a trusted CA. This process establishes trust in the server's public key and enables secure communication.

In summary, the server's public key allows clients to encrypt data and verify the server's digital signatures, while the server's certificate verifies the authenticity and integrity of the server's public key, assuring clients that they are communicating with the intended server.
